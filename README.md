# python-bible-ex
Coding exercises from [The Python Bible(TM) Everything You Need to Program in Python](https://ibm-learning.udemy.com/course/the-python-bible) course on Udemy. This was a refresher course for me. My goals for this repository are:
1. Vscode devcontainer setup for Python development.
2. Test-driven coding with pytest.
3. Linting with flake8.
4. Formatting with black.
