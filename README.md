# python-bible-ex
Coding exercises from [The Python Bible(TM) Everything You Need to Program in Python](https://ibm-learning.udemy.com/course/the-python-bible) course on Udemy. This was a refresher course for me. My goals for this repository are:
1. Vscode devcontainer setup for Python development.
2. Test-driven coding with pytest.
3. Linting with flake8.
4. Formatting with black.

## Supported Platforms
I did this project on Windows11/WSL2/Ubuntu. YMMV.

## Dependencies
1. Docker or a clone thereof, like [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) (recommended!).

## Installation
Just clone the repository. It should open in VSCode if you have wsl and docker setup correctly.
